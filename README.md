Solving the hackerrank service lane puzzle

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/service-lane

Series of integers, find the smallest integer in a segment of an array. This solution is O( T*N ), where T is the number of 
test cases and N is the size of the array.

There is a clever O(T + N) solution, but it's a lot more code. Don't think it was the aim of the exercise.
